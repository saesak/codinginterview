If you're taking an online assessment,

Look at all the problems listed then see which
ones you can solve quickly (usually you can tell just by)
the descriptions and finish those quickly, then tackle the hard ones
with the remaining time. 

If something takes you like 15+ minutes, consider ditching it.

Especially for the codesignal tests I've taken so far
I need to first do the easy ones then the hard one.
