Unpacking a function using positional argument.
This method is very useful while printing your data in a raw format (without any comma and brackets ). Many of the programmer try to remove comma and bracket by using a convolution of functions, Hence this simple prefix asterisk can solve your problem in unpacking them.  
Python3

arr = ['sunday', 'monday', 'tuesday', 'wednesday']
  
# without using asterisk
print(' '.join(map(str,arr))) 
  
# using asterisk
print (*arr)
